Trojan Description
	?At the core of lightweight applications, such as medical implant devices,are the batteries that power them and 
	the success of the device restsheavily on them. This Trojan drains the battery once it is activated. The Trojan 
	gets activated after observing a specific sequence of the input plain text. The Trojan payload is a shift register 
	which continuously rotates after Trojan activation. The Trojan increases the power consumption and hence decreases 
	the expected lifetime of the battery.
